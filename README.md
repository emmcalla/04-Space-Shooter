# Project-Template-Godot
A default Godot project template for MSCH-C220.

Using the template provided, I created a simple space shooter game. A ship will fly around and shoot enemy space ships as well as a secret enemy. Meteors will also damage your ship. Die and a lose scene.

This project was used as an introductory project to Godot.
